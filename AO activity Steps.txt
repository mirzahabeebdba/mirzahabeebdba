1) Remove database from AG
USE [master]
GO
ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP [EWSSP2013CH]
REMOVE DATABASE [DB_NAME];
GO

2) Shrink log file (change recovery mode to simple before shrinking)
alter database [DB_NAME] set recovery simple

USE [DB_NAME]
GO
DBCC SHRINKFILE (N'DB_LOGICAL_LOG_FILE_NAME' , 0, TRUNCATEONLY)
GO

alter database [DB_NAME] set recovery Full 

3)Take FUll backup

BACKUP DATABASE [DB_NAME] 
TO  DISK = N'L:\AO_SYNC\DB_NAME.bak' WITH NOFORMAT, NOINIT,  
SKIP, NOREWIND, NOUNLOAD, COMPRESSION,  STATS = 10
GO

4) Take t-log backup

backup log Online_Search_appliance_service_application_CrawlStore to disk ='L:\AO_SYNC\DB_NAME.trn'with  COMPRESSION,  STATS = 10

5) move the full and tlog backups from primary to secondary

L:\AO_SYNC to \\GLCHBS-SP360180\l$\AO_SYNC

The files which gets copied to seconday please move them to folder L:\AO_SYNC\copied_to_secondary from L:\AO_SYNC in primary server 

6)Restore full backup from primary in secondary

USE [master]
RESTORE DATABASE [DB_NAME] FROM  DISK = N'L:\AO_SYNC\DB_NAME.bak' WITH  FILE = 1,  NORECOVERY,  NOUNLOAD,  REPLACE,  STATS = 5
GO

7) Restore TLog backup from primary in secondary

RESTORE LOG [DB_NAME] FROM  DISK = N'L:\AO_SYNC\DB_NAME.trn' WITH  FILE = 1,  NORECOVERY,  NOUNLOAD,  STATS = 10
GO

8) Add DB in AAG group from primary

USE master
ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP EWSSP2013CH ADD DATABASE [Online_Search_appliance_service_application]  

9) Join the database to AAG group from secondary: 

-- Wait for the replica to start communicating
begin try
declare @conn bit
declare @count int
declare @replica_id uniqueidentifier 
declare @group_id uniqueidentifier
set @conn = 0
set @count = 30 -- wait for 5 minutes 

if (serverproperty('IsHadrEnabled') = 1)
	and (isnull((select member_state from master.sys.dm_hadr_cluster_members where upper(member_name COLLATE Latin1_General_CI_AS) = upper(cast(serverproperty('ComputerNamePhysicalNetBIOS') as nvarchar(256)) COLLATE Latin1_General_CI_AS)), 0) <> 0)
	and (isnull((select state from master.sys.database_mirroring_endpoints), 1) = 0)
begin
    select @group_id = ags.group_id from master.sys.availability_groups as ags where name = N'EWSSP2013CH'
	select @replica_id = replicas.replica_id from master.sys.availability_replicas as replicas where upper(replicas.replica_server_name COLLATE Latin1_General_CI_AS) = upper(@@SERVERNAME COLLATE Latin1_General_CI_AS) and group_id = @group_id
	while @conn <> 1 and @count > 0
	begin
		set @conn = isnull((select connected_state from master.sys.dm_hadr_availability_replica_states as states where states.replica_id = @replica_id), 1)
		if @conn = 1
		begin
			-- exit loop when the replica is connected, or if the query cannot find the replica status
			break
		end
		waitfor delay '00:00:10'
		set @count = @count - 1
	end
end
end try
begin catch
	-- If the wait loop fails, do not stop execution of the alter database statement
end catch
ALTER DATABASE [DB_NAME] SET HADR AVAILABILITY GROUP = [EWSSP2013CH];

GO

10) Wait for db to initialize after joining. Check its status from SQL server databases and AAG databases. If required, navigate to the secondary instance AAG and Join the DB from secondary in AAG group.

11) Check the sync parameters in AAG dashboard to verify database is synchronizing.
Also validate that the database is in ynchronized status in primary and synchronizing status in secondary.
